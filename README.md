# About me
###### My name is Katarzyna and I have professional experience in software testing and data analysis. Some time ago, I gained my ISTQB FL certification and got a chance to be part of the Scrum team as a QA Intern. During my internship, I worked as part of the Feature Team and took over the full responsibilities of Junior Software Tester. I was familiar with the software development cycle (Waterfall and Agile methodologies) and worked in SCRUM and SAFe. I really enjoyed this testing adventure.  I think my previous work experience taught me a pro-client attitude. I have an eye for detail and experience working in a financial institution and in an international environment. I had the opportunity to test applications, design and write test cases. I have also had the opportunity to work with various stakeholders, which is essential to properly prepare and document post-test results / findings.  Currently, I have completed the Automated Tests + Phyton course and I am interested in professional development in the area of software testing with an opportunity to grow as a Junior Automation Tester.
